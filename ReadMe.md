The goal of this project is to build a ping CLI with C#, To help me understand network programming and working with raw memory and networking this is part of many side projects that i am working.

Along side i am trying to learn dotnet-benchmark and unit testing mission critical software. i am learning and putting project piece by piece along side improving my knowledge of network programming, C# and ecosystem of tools that is related to C# and build software in general.

Too learn more about project i am working on you can visit my website chandu.cc where i blog about everything computer science, software engineering i have lot of passion for technology, computer science.
